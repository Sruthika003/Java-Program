Difference between static, local and instance variable

Static variable:
 => A variable that is declared as static and defined outside any method. It cannot be local.
 => Memory allocated only once when the class is loaded.
 => Initialized only once when the class is loaded.
 => They can be called using class name or using any of the object instances.
 => Only one copy exists, shared among all instances of the class.
 
 Local Variable:
 => Local variables declared inside a method,constructor or bloack.
 => Memory allocated when the method or block is executed.
 => Must be initialized before use.
 => A local variable must be initialized before you try to use it, else compiler will complain.
 => We can create a copy of a local variable by assigning its value to a new variable within the same scope.
 
 Instance Variable:
 => Instance variable declared inside a class but outside a method, constructor or any block.
 => Memory allocated each time a new instance is created.
 => Initialized each time a new instance is created.
 => They can be called using any of the object instances. 
 => Each instance has its own copy of the variable.
